# Android 12 support

If you use `targetSdk 31`, this SDK version is **required**.
You will also need to upgrade the version of our FCM module to [v1.0.4](https://github.com/wonderpush/wonderpush-flutter-sdk/releases/tag/fcm-v1.0.4) minimum.

Here is a more detailed outline of the changes:
  * Adapt to the [Notification trampoline restrictions](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#notification-trampolines)
  * Remove now-unnecessary and now-restricted use of [the `ACTION_CLOSE_SYSTEM_DIALOGS` intent](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#close-system-dialogs).
  * Fix missing `@APP_OPEN` events when an activity is resumed after a long time, [like Android 12 now does](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#back-press) when pressing back on the root activity.
  * Handle a few deprecations

## 2.1.3
* Use iOS SDK v4.0.4
* Use Android SDK v4.0.7

  * Fix NPE on setUserId() called quickly after first startup
  * Support for collapsible big pictures
  * Fix a ClassNotFoundException when notification opens an external app.
  * Small fix to ensure a bad configuration does not prevent any received notification from being displayed due to an invalid small icon resource. If you are impacted then you must upgrade our FCM module to v1.0.2 to fix further issues.
